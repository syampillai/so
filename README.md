## Dart client for SO Platform.  
  
SO platform is an object-oriented framework for developing enterprise Java applications with a PostgreSQL database
back-end. Developers typically write "data classes" (classes that represent tables in the database) and
"logic classes" (classes implementing web UI, reporting and processing logic). All such developer-defined classes are
stored in the database itself like any other business data. Logic classes can be attached to "menu options" of the
application and the logic executes when the menu option is selected by the end-user.  

## Features

This library can be used to connect to SO platform from dart (and flutter) applications. Typically,
it is used by mobile application developers to create customized mobile front-ends for the SO platform.
